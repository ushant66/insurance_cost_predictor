###  Factors Affecting Insurance Premiums

Many factors that affect how much you pay for health insurance are not within your control. Nonetheless, it's good to have an understanding of what they are. Here are some factors that affect how much health insurance premiums cost:

- **age**: Age of primary beneficiary.
- **sex**: Insurance contractor gender, female or male.
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²), ideally 18.5 to 24.9.
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / dependents.
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes/no).
- **region**: Beneficiary's residential area in the US: northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
